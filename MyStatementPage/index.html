             <h1>My Statement</h1>
            <p> This site was made thanks to the help of online guides and done using primarily HTML and CSS. </p>

            <p> I'm no stranger to the internet, like most people my age, but a lot of people have trouble putting themselves out there, and I totally understand. It's a part of you, and sometimes a very vulnerable part as well. I have nothing but respect for people who create for themselves.</p>

            <p>I've always had trouble trying to establish myself, so I made this guide to help others. The internet is vast, and not everyone knows where to start, so I would just like to lend a simple hand as well as dish out my own personal expeirences.</p>
