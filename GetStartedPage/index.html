        <h2> Some of you may or may not have accounts by the time you read this, and that's okay! <h2>

            <p> The first step would be to create one. Not only will they be used to garner clout online, but to also generally network and familiarize yourself with your own surroundings. </p>

            <h2> 1. Have a consistent brand </h2>
            <p> I strongly advise you try to keep a unique (or at the very least, simllar) username or social media handle to make things easy for not only yourself, but for others when finding you.</p>

            <p> It also helps to make your own logo or have your own color scheme, that way you can be more unified and recognizable. (see Resources)</p>

            <h2> 2. Choosing the best platforms</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Twitter</b> - very much a jack of all trades site, considering it is a micro-blogging site. Publish text, images, videos, but also be aware of the character limit and the site's generally shorter attention span. </li>
              <li><b>Instagram</b> - with a focus on images and especially reels/videos now, this site will work best if your work is mostly related to media that can easily be seen. </li>
              <li><b>Tumblr</b> - also a microblogging site, but has way more diversity when it comes to embedding certain media. There is no text limit compared to Twitter, making this great for people who want to make wordier posts.</li>
              <li> <b>LinkedIn </b> - best used for any career-related purposes. A strong emphasis on professionalism, but also gives a lot of points for networking especially here. A connection can mean a lot, and it's a norm to reach out to others on the site!</li>
              <li> <b> Facebook </b>- great for keeping in touch with others and groups/pages for events or gathers. Downside is that Facebook may have lower activity or a less "relevant" userbase compared to other sites here.</li>
              <li><b>Tiktok </b> - more or less completely video based, but the content you creative doesn't have to exclusively be just reels. Remember, you can post tutorials, pointers, and more in video format and still maintain relevancy on the platform. </li>
            </ul>

            <p> Remember that you can expand yourself to as many platforms as possible, but also bear in mind that you will only have so much time in your day to dedicate to a few sites at at time! </p>

            <h2> 3. Have a general site </h2>
            <p> Whether it be a portfolio site, or a simple webpage that links to your other social media, it's always good to have your own general site. Job recruiters, friends, and more will also find this easy when it comes to navigating your own brand. </p>
